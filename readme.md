In general my website is defined by:

<video>: where is defined my video loop for my background and also a static <img> when the browser does not suport <video>;
<div>: Is the last section of my website, where is my text and also a <form> on the page contact.html;
<form>: Where you can find the <label>, <input> and <button> tags composing a html form (only on page contact.html).
