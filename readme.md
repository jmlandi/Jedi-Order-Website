# Welcome! 📜

This is my **Star Wars Website**! Nice to have you here.
### link to my website: 

## Objective ☕️

Do a desktop website using HTML and CSS.

## HTML Tags 🛠

### Considering HTML structure, in general my website is defined by
- <strong>header tag</strong> ➡ Where is defined my navegation bar using ul tag and also has my h1 tag for SEO
- <strong>video tag</strong> ➡ where is defined my video loop for my background and also a static img when the browser does not suport video tag
- <strong>div tag</strong> ➡ Is the last section of my website, where is my text (h3 tag and p tag) and also a <form> on the page contact.html
- <strong>form tag</strong> ➡ Where you can find the label tag, input tags and button tag composing a html form (only on page contact.html).

## CSS Selectors 🛠

### Considering CSS structure, in general my website is defined by
- <strong>* Selector</strong> ➡ Defining default attributes like margin, padding, transition box-sizing and fonts. 
I'm also using classes and IDs to definy the style. Using '::hover' to define hover actions with diferent colors, 'display:flex;' to align items and 'position:absolute;' to overlay some elements. 

## Hope you liked it! 🤞
